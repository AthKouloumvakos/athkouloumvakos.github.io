<img src="./assets/images/Solar_Orbiter_mission_logo.png" width="250pix" align="right" alt="Group Website banner">  <p> I am a solar and space physics researcher working at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). I was born and raised in Athens, the birthplace of democracy, arts, science and philosophy of western civilisation, and the capital of Greece. I have studied Physics in the University of Patras, in the third-largest city and the regional capital of Western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese. Then, I obtained a M.Sc. on Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Mechanics from the University of Athens. In 2018, I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Ioannina studing the physics of shock waves in the solar corona and interplanetary space. I coninued with my post-doctorate research at the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie, at Toulouse in France, for four years. From the begining of 2022, I moved to Maryland and I am working as a post-doctoral researcher for the Space Exploration Sector of the Applied Physics Laboratory. I am also a research scientist for the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS) instrument onboard Solar Orbiter. The Solar Orbiter mission, is an ESA-led mission with strong NASA participation and launched from Cape Canaveral on 10 February 2020. </p>

<p> Overal, my research activities center on the properties of shock waves in the solar corona and interplanetary space, the properties of solar energetic particles, solar radio-physics, and space weather. I embrace every research opportunity, and I work enthusiastically trying to produce scientific results that are at the cutting edge of solar and space physics research. I have a broad collaborating experience and my participation in various research projects has advanced my skills in various topics. My expertise is broad in the analysis and interpretation of in-situ data and remote sensing solar observations in different spectral domains that are collected by various spacecraft instrumentation onboard NASA and ESA space missions. These datasets allow me to study shock waves, eruptive events, solar energetic particles, solar radio and gamma-ray emmision from the Sun. I have more than 30 Publications in high-impact international peer-review Journals and numerous presentations in international conferences. I have refereed articles for numerous international Journals in the field, including The Astrophysical Journal and the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal.</p>
